## Word Count Display for Fillout Forms

This utility adds a real-time word count feature to text areas in [Fillout](https://www.fillout.com?ref=asafdafna) forms. By inserting this HTML/JavaScript snippet as an HTML block in your form, users can track their word count in real time, with an optional limit to improve form usability and accessibility.

### Key Features
- **Real-Time Word Count**: Automatically updates as the user types.
- **Customizable Target**: Works with text areas identified by the `aria-label` attribute. Replace `"YOUR_UNIQUE_ARIA_LABEL"` in the script with the `aria-label` of your target text area.
- **Optional Word Limit**: Set a maximum word count, and the utility will visually indicate when the limit is exceeded by changing the background and text color of the word count element.
- **Customizable Colors**: Easily change the default and warning colors to match your form's design.
